# Airline-review-analysis

This sentiment analysis project demonstrated the power of machine learning models, especially Support Vector Machine (SVM), in accurately classifying customer sentiments. The project highlighted key customer issues in the airline industry, particularly around negative experiences like flight delays and poor customer service. By using n-grams and TF-IDF to capture word associations and addressing data imbalance with SMOTE, the model was able to accurately analyze customer feedback and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral.
